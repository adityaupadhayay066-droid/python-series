# 🐍 Python Series – Beginner to Intermediate Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Python projects** created to practice and strengthen
core programming concepts such as **logic building, problem solving, loops, functions,
conditionals, file handling, GUI development, and data processing**.

These projects represent my learning journey in Python and my transition from
**basic scripts to real-world mini applications** 🚀
